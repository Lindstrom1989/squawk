#Squawk

Squawk is a web application that quickly adds captions to your videos with ease to aid your viewers with poor or no hearing, foreign speaking or no audio output.

The idea is to give the program a url and record caption inputs whilst playing the video, once finished the user can type in the captions for each part, delete caption inputs and play the video from when that caption is recorded.
When the captions are saved the user can generate a webvtt file (.vtt) which can be added to their video.

This is a project for my learning and progression with various web technologies, primarily javascript.

##Things to do

###JavaScript

- [x] Give the ability to use more video formats
- [x] Only enable record button whilst video is playing
- [x] Turn play button into play/pause button
- [ ] Disable play button if no media is loaded
- [x] Optimise repeated code
- [x] Optimise function parts to smaller functions to be reused
- [ ] Possibly pass data from captions into an object
- [ ] Change the tick when saved to a pseudo : before for that list item or input?

###CSS

- [ ] Continue styling break points
- [ ] Optimise to sass
- [ ] Think of a better time stamp format
- [ ] Think of a way to have the video fixed for mobile
- [ ] Animate record button on focus

###HTML

- [ ] Optimise layout
- [x] Meta
- [ ] Create more informative instructions
- [ ] Find a talking source video

###More ideas

- [ ] Implement a logo
- [ ] Think about how buttons will work on mobile (momentary record)
